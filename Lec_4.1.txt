Docker Compose
-docker compose is a tool
-running and creating multi container application
-deploying and managing multi container app in single engine mode
-using docker-compose.yml


Setup
1. verify 
docker-compose --version
with docker desktop it is available otherwise install it

2. docker-compose up
3. docker image ls
4. docker container ls
5. hit url on broser http://127.0.0.1:5000/


docker attach vs exec
1. docker attach is meant for attaching existing process/running process to container
single instance
2. docker exec gives a new process itself for running container
new process --> multiple instances

example- run ubuntu container
if we attach /bin/bash, we get only single instance of bash, open two cmds and it will act as single instance --> changes in one cmd will copy in another one.
if we exec /bin/bash we can have multiple instances of bash

docker-compose down vs stop
1. down deletes all resources after stopping container
C:\Development\DockerKubernatesTerraform\counter-app>docker-compose down
Stopping counter-app_web-fe_1 ... done
Stopping counter-app_redis_1  ... done
Removing counter-app_web-fe_1 ... done
Removing counter-app_redis_1  ... done
Removing network counter-app_counter-net

2. stop just to stop container without deleting resources
C:\Development\DockerKubernatesTerraform\counter-app>docker-compose stop
Stopping counter-app_web-fe_1 ... done
Stopping counter-app_redis_1  ... done

-Docker Volume
once containers are running we can check data generated and used by container using volume

docker volume inspect counter-app_counter-vol

docker volume inspect counter-app_counter-vol | grep Mount
