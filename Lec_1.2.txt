Docker

1. what is image?
ans: create containers --> for run application --> whatever else our application needs for execution -->
package all these together --> IMAGE

Image --> unit of packaing everything our application needs for execution


2. Container vs Image
ans: setting and configuration build time --> image
actual executing --> container

image are small --> container is using host Os/kernel(shared mode)

Image tag -->
<repository>:<tag>
if we don't give tag, its default

docker image pull -a mysql
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server

docker image rm mysql:lates

conatiner
image in execution



1. ubuntu bash
if you are running directly without local image pull still it downloads and run
docker container run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash

2. inspect for detail
docker container inspect container_id

3. in bash
Note :E: Unable to locate package curl first time
apt-get update
apt-get install curl

now everything as it is normal ubuntu machine -but get your packages
